{"name":"Ulysses' Backstory","permission":{"default":0,"NDNjYjU4MTMyYzYy":3},"flags":{"R20Converter":{"handout-order":4,"handout-archived":false}},"content":"<p>@Actor[Ulysses] was born in a simple farming village, to what might have been an idealistic existence, had it not been for his hellish lineage. His mothers infidelity revealed to the man who should have been his father resulted in their separation. His mother wished only to put her shame behind her, leaving Ulysses with only his name, in the care of the Temple of {Not Turok}.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The temples care was not tender, Ulysses learned quickly to stay unnoticed whenever possible. Completing his chores as well as he was able. Ulysses was regularly the target of \"Discipline\" in regards to his studies, the priests constant reminders that if he wished to defy his nature and avoid the hells for which he was destined he need \"only\" pledge his being to {Not Turok, become a priest or holy warrior, even a simple monk. The care of the priesthood only grew sterner as Ulysses grew older, by the time he was a young teen it had become apparent to everyone that Ulysses would not be a worthy devotee of Turok so instead they simple aimed to keep him from embracing his heritage. In his final few years a Warrior by the name of Ingrid took Ulysses as her Squire.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ingrid taught Ulysses the basics of combat, sword play and riding. But he didn't take too well to the training, So would lecture him constantly on the things she had seen, about necromancer and cultists she had brought to the light, a gentler approach than the priesthood to be sure but too little too late for Ulysses, years of lectures by the priesthood had made him resentful towards them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ingrid would leave Ulysses in town when she would track dangerous individuals, often for days or weeks at a time. It was during one such adventure that things took a turn for the worse, while tracking a deserter from Imperial army toward the coast Ingrid left Ulysses with some coin and \"invited\" him to do what he could to help the townsfolk in Turoks name, his feelings for Turok not withstanding he respected Ingrid enough to at least offer some help to the poor in *her* name.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While he wasn't skilled with a blade, Ulysses had picked up a fair amount of skill with the crossbow, so when the poor of the village expressed the winter had been harsh and their food stores were dwindling he agreed to go hunting on their behalf. While usually reserved for the lord of the land, servants of the temple on the road were also permitted to hunt the lands. So he went to try and track down a buck, or hell at least some rabbits.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The forest was clearly old growth, the kind of density that takes centuries to achieve, think interwoven roots reaching out of the ground 3-4 feet at times, making his passage slow. Before he'd realised it the day had passed him by, without seeing the sun it was difficult to track the hours. No matter, Ulysses had slept rough before, a warm fire and a bedroll were good enough for him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As if sensing his contentment with his current life the world decided to remind Ulysses of his place in it, the storm that woke him from his slumber was intense, although still distant, the frequency of the thunder let him know that a warm fire and a bedroll wouldn't be enough this night, before entering the woods Ulysses had noticed several large outcroppings on its eastern edge, if he had judged his progress correctly he should make it there before the storm swallowed him. He had as usual, overestimated his luck. The downpour reached Ulysses a full hour before he reached the stone tower that he could now see was clearly carved and not simply jutting from the ground, old and overgrown but it would serve as a better shelter that the trees at least.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The roof had long since caved in, or been removed. It was difficult to tell. Ulysses was about to check one of the other towers when he noticed a trap door beside a heart, perhaps to a root cellar or a dungeon, better than nothing. Hopefully something down there would be dry enough to burn. An old rusted lock proved little resistance, thankfully Ingrid had either not realised or at least not stopped Ulysses from practising lock picking, he'd never robbed a house. It was like a meditation for him almost.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Things took a turn for the strange almost immediately, Ulysses was barely down half a flight of stairs when the walls on either side of him vanished, behind the vision his infernal eyes granted him he could swear he saw pinpricks of light... stars? He immediately turned to leave but found that the stairs behind him had changed, running deeper into this anti-space. The more he looked around the less things made sense, directly above him was the roof of a tower, as if he were looking down upon it from a birds view, all around him stairs ran in odd directions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After a while of panicked running didn't lead him from the strange place he was in, and a swift slap to the face didn't wake him up Ulysses decided to take a minute to assess what he could. How long had he been here already, it was as though he had lost all judgement of time, had it been seconds or years, the two seemed almost the same here. Nothing for it now but to keep going, hope to find a way back out. Instead he got more and more lost, if that was even possible in this place.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Working his way deeper he eventually came upon a huge outstretched floor, columns so high they seemed to be holding up the very sky in here. and in the centre a pyramid of stairs, upon which sat a throne, decayed and broken, one of the arms missing and the back snapped at the mid. Upon the throne sat a man, so utterly non-descript that it was almost hard to place his features at all.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As the man began to speak, he voice filling the space entirely he began to recount his life, in vague details \"I too, was judged for naught but my lineage...\" \"What would the gods know of mortal struggles\" \"Why do they who do not walk our road, decide our destination\" \"In these thoughts we are of like mind...\" Ulysses circled the throne, but ever the mans eyes were locked to his, no matter how far he walked. Finally the man stood, walking down the pyramid of stairs, the world shrinking around him as he did. Before Ulysses could comprehend what was going on he was face to face with the man. \"I am The Everking, and I offer you an escape from fate, an end to divine tyranny and a place in eternity, you need but step forward\" As he stepped forward his foot found not stone but soft grass, he was back at the village...</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ulysses staggered as an unexpected weight nearly pulled him over, a stags dead eye met his own, slung over his shoulder. The sun felt warm on his clothes, now dry. Feeling the strain of the Stags weight he decided to press on into the village. He soon found the small group of families he had offered his aid to, an elderly man sitting on one of the porches clearly ruined by years of hard labour looked at Ulysses with surprise, a quick conversation later revealed that Ulysses had been gone not even half an hour by the villagers perceptions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Several days of soul searching in the tavern went by, Ulysses had stepped forward without thinking, had he made the right choice? Was it possible to know? Would Ingrid be able to tell when she got back... Eventually a commotion disturbed his not-meditation, a shrill scream drew his attention out of his window, a man in a ragged uniform and grimy breastplate stood in the square, a womans hair grasped in his mailed hand. A blade in the other, he appeared to be in the middle of addressing the crowd but Ulysses couldn't hear what he was saying, cursing the distance between them. His sense flickered, next he know he was attached to a statue in the town square and could hear the mans threats as clear as day \"... So unless this *Holy* warrior of yours steps out right now! Unarmed... This bitch will get a *very* unpleasant hair cut... You have 1 minute.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Apparently somebody had tipped off the deserter to Ingrids assignment to bring him in, and he didn't like it very much. If Ingrid was nearby she'd have already revealed herself, and it's not like Paladins of Turok just appear out of thin air because you call them out... Unless they did. Once more stepping forward before he had registered the decision Ulysses strode from the tavern to face the man, he left his crossbow behind. The man had said unarmed. If he could just talk him down until Ingrid arrived she could deal with this.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A brief conversation with the deserter let Ulysses know pretty quickly the man had no intention of being held to account, within 30 seconds of \"Sir Ulysses\" appearing the man had devolved into incoherent screaming about not going back to \"Their Clutches\" throwing the woman to one side and cutting wide swathes through the air with his long blade. The fight was short lived, the man had clearly not eaten in days and had barely the strength to lift his blade. Ulysses simply waited for the man to tired himself out from his wild swinging, keeping as much distance between them as he could, once the man collapsed to one knee he wrestled the blade away, throwing off behind them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ulysses was getting ready to perform his best Ingrid impression and read the poor bastard his rights when the man produced a boot knife, before Ulysses could consciously react he raised his hand in defence, a dull grey energy, speckled with white pin pricks of light shot from his hand into the mans face, a sickening wet crunch boomed in his ears...</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ulysses didn't stay long after that, didn't even wait for Ingrid to return, he just packed a bag and picked a road. That was two years ago now, Ulysses had learned a great deal about his power since then, he'd been playing cat and mouse with Ingrid since then, she was clearly looking for him and she was getting too close, so with no better options Ulysses gathered up what he could and sold it for a ticket to the new continent, hopefully Turok hadn't made it there yet...</p>\n<div><br /><br /></div>","img":"","_id":"ScJwAdgFd3tHFgF9"}

She doesn't even have the clearest memories of the day she washed up on the shores of a small island inhabited only by a slightly eccentric and secretive wizard who called himself Arda; only the feeling of falling a long way and the sounds of a storm. And the wizard stumbling across her on a beach, half-dead and missing an eye, a brand on her wrist in Draconic numerals.<br><br>Neither had a clue how she even ended up on the island, and she spoke only Draconic and the language of some obscure dream-spirits at the time. Combined with a slightly odd appearance and the confusing instinct that elements of the world should work very differently than they did, her overall strangeness seemed to present enough of an enticing mystery for Arda to offer her a place to stay until she recovered, or at least that's what she assumed. He even gave her a name until she could recall one of her own: Wren.<br><br>Over the weeks of her recovery no memories returned to Wren, although she became aware of a kind of presence somewhere in the back of her mind, like a second set of instincts almost. After some observation it was deemed curious but apparently harmless. Arda claimed he would continue to look into the situation but Wren's origin remained a mystery to him. Even infrequent visitors and trips to the mainland found no news of a missing girl like her or even recent shipwrecks she might have come from.<br><br>Eventually Wren regained enough strength to start helping out around Arda's home in simple ways, trying to repay his generosity by tidying up and organizing the place. The weeks turned into months and Wren somehow became something of an assistant in Arda's work and studies. A little over a year later, he offered her a formal apprenticeship that she eagerly accepted; she had nowhere else to go and less hope every day of remembering anything, but this weird island and the old house on it had become her home anyway.<br><br>With the beginning of real magical instruction, Wren gained some insight into the true nature of Arda's work – it seemed people often came to him seeking favours and somewhat more unusual works of magic, while in his own time he furthered his own knowledge. Even still there were elements of this work that he didn't yet involve Wren in, explaining only that it would be safer to do so when she had more training.<br><br>This arrangement continued for four years. In all that time the only new clue Wren got about herself was the realization that she did not in fact dream. When she slept, she was seeing the memories of whatever strange second-presence rattled around her brain, and she awoke one morning with the knowledge that this presence had a name: Vasir.<br><br>In one afternoon, the home and life Wren had found shattered. Strangers accompanied by figures made of shadow and wisps appeared on the island, breaking into their home and attempting to either capture or harm Arda. Before Wren could even raise a spell in defence, Arda simply grabbed her and fled into a sealed room within the house. With a brief moment of safety he began to cast a spell from a scroll. By the time Wren realized it targeted her it was too late. The Imprisonment spell took hold and she was left alone trapped within a topaz, then dropped into a bag and knew nothing of what followed, being alone in the dark for what felt like eternity.<br><br>Once the darkness finally receded, her topaz was in the hands of a trader who viewed it only as a charming magical trinket. It was sold on to a collector, and then again to another who was murdered in a robbery. Passed on to an appraiser by the thief, Wren was finally freed by the simply act of someone trying to cut through the topaz and she fled before she could be made to answer any questions.<br><br>She was lost in a strange place, alone, and clueless as to what had happened to Arda and their island. Her despair only grew when she found out she had been in that gem for 5 years. It was only thanks to that white-noise of Vasir's company that she hadn't gone mad, and only by his instincts that they survived those first few weeks alone in the world.<br><br>But now she has found a new sort of life in doing small jobs, offering what little magic she had, just getting by while searching for an island and a wizard no one seems to have ever heard of.<br></p>","img":""}

You will need, at minimum: The heart of a fire giant or fire elemental and a pneuma flower boiled in the blood of a devil from the Nine Hells.
